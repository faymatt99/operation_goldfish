Variable Naming Convention

Keep all variable names the same.

Any variable that is modified should be made into a new column. The name of the variable column should be "Variable_MOD", where MOD describes the modification. 
EXAMPLE: 
Converting "KitchenQual" from a categorical to ordinal will become "KitchenQual_Ord". Then, you can add the new variable to our data dictionary.
KitchenQual -> KitchenQual_Ord

For a variable that you think might be removed from the analysis, rename the variable "maybe_Variable".
For any variable that you recommend definitely be removed from the analysis, rename the variable "drop_Variable".
EXAMPLE: 
To mark "MiscFeature" for deletion, it will become "drop_MiscFeature".
MiscFeature -> drop_MiscFeature

Values for variables can be changed for nominal categorical to clarify the meaning.
